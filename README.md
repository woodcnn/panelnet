Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a network architecture for deep learning that learns directly from data. CNN are used to obtain patterns from images to recognize objects, classes, and categories. These are used to classify audio, time series, and signal data. MobileNet is a CNN architecture that is developed to build light-weight deep neural networks. Image classification categorizes the input images into pre-defined labels or categories. The dataset has three exclusive categories; PASS, FAIL, and empty (#), with each category containing 1000 samples. The empty (#) category is to be filled with random pictures of choice. These should be anything but pictures of wooden panels. The train_mobile_net.py code is used to train the network with the dataset. The use_mobile_net.py code is used for image recognition. The samples containing high-quality panels are categorized as PASS, and broken or defective panels are categorized as FAIL. If there are no panels, then the CNN defaults to the empty (#) category.
